##  Job Scheduler Microservice — Scalable Architecture & Deployment Strategy

This document explains how the **Job Scheduler Microservice** is designed, scaled, and deployed using **Docker**, **Redis**, and **SOLID principles**. It focuses on making the system **production-ready**, **highly available**, and **maintainable**.

---

##  Overview

The Job Scheduler Service automates the scheduling and execution of recurring jobs using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **node-cron**.  
It follows a **modular microservice architecture**, allowing independent scaling and deployment.

The service supports:
- Dynamic job creation and listing.
- Cron-based scheduling.
- Caching with Redis.
- Scalable deployment via Docker & Kubernetes.

##  Architecture Components

| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Express Server** | Handles RESTful API requests and routes. |
| **Controller Layer** | Implements business logic for job creation, listing, and retrieval. |
| **Scheduler Utility** | Uses node-cron to execute jobs at defined intervals. |
| **MongoDB** | Stores job metadata and configuration. |
| **Redis Cache** | Provides in-memory caching to reduce DB hits. |
| **Docker Containerization** | Enables reproducible builds and scalable deployments. |

##  Scalability Layers

### 1 Application Layer
- **Non-blocking architecture** with asynchronous Node.js event loop.
- **Controller–Service–Model** separation for clean structure.
- **Load-balanced instances** can run parallelly to handle more requests.

### 2️ Data Layer
- Uses **MongoDB** for persistent job storage.
- Integrates **Redis** for caching job data and reducing query time.
- Can implement **distributed locking** to prevent job duplication.

### 3️ Deployment Layer
- Containerized with **Docker** and stored in **Docker Hub**.
- Can be deployed on **Kubernetes** with horizontal scaling.
- Load balancing with **NGINX** or cloud-native balancers.
